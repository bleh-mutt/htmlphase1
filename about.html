        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>A passionate and driven Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning
            and software engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation
             in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, as well as problem-solving, algorithm design, and software 
             development principles. I am excited about applying my knowledge to real-world challenges and creating innovative solutions.
             <br><br>
            In addition to my academic coursework, I've worked on various personal projects and internships that have helped me hone my skills in 
            JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Python. I'm always eager to learn
             new technologies and grow as a developer, and I believe that hands-on experience is key to expanding my expertise.
            <br><br>
            This portfolio showcases some of my best work. Iâ€™m excited to continue expanding my skills and collaborating with like-minded individuals
             on meaningful projects. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
